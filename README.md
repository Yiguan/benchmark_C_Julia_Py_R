# benchmark_C_Julia_Py_R

I am interested in the performance of Julia and trying to compare it with other program languages, including C, Python and R. Here, I compared the four languages by calculating Fibonacci numbers and searching for prime numbers.

I thought Python and R should have similar performance. But the test shows that Python is pretty faster than R! Meanwhile, Julia seems a bit faster than Python but not as faster as I expected. 

The tests are subject to various factor, including hardwares and software versions...
